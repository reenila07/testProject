This assignment intends to demonstrate understanding of the concepts and materials covered in the specific topic of Management Information System by creating an engaging and instructional film. A management information system (MIS) is an information system that collects, stores, and analyses data from various processes. MIS is a system that provides managers with the relevant and important data they need to make decisions about how to run the company. The specific topic we have decided to investigate is emerging technology in Management Information Systems, specifically focusing on AI digital assistants. We investigate this topic with four examples of common digital assistants that most people are familiar with or have used. Natural Processing Language (NLP) is the ability of the computer to understand as it is spoken and written referred to as natural language. It is a component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is commonly used in digital assistants, and so we have also focused on NLP.  There are certain challenges in natural language processing that frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding and natural language generation.
