Emerging tech in MIS, AI (Digital Assistants)

Introduction
This assignment intends to demonstrate understanding of the concepts and materials covered in the specific topic of Management Information System by creating an engaging and instructional film. A management information system (MIS) is an information system that collects, stores, and analyses data from various processes. MIS is a system that provides managers with the relevant and important data they need to make decisions about how to run the company. The specific topic we have decided to investigate is emerging technology in Management Information Systems, specifically focusing on AI digital assistants. We investigate this topic with four examples of common digital assistants that most people are familiar with or have used. Natural Processing Language (NLP) is the ability of the computer to understand as it is spoken and written referred to as natural language. It is a component of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is commonly used in digital assistants, and so we have also focused on NLP.  There are certain challenges in natural language processing that frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding and natural language generation.

Methodology
To create the video, our team first began with researching emerging technology in Management Information Systems in general, which led to many examples of new and innovative types of technology that have the potential to impact the field of information systems and how organisations manage and process data. We then narrowed our search to researching Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies. After pooling together the research, we discussed our findings and created a script for the video. The tools we used are google images for the visual content and Invideo to create the video. We faced some challenges with navigating InVideo as a team, so we delegated the task to one group member that is the most proficient in assembling the video.  			 	

Video Content
We'll concentrate on applications of artificial intelligence (AI) that are commonly employed right now, globally. Virtual personal assistants like Alexa from Amazon, Siri from Apple, Google Assistant, and Cortana from Microsoft are a few examples. These tools utilise AI algorithms to understand voice commands, respond to inquiries, carry out activities, and provide users recommendations. The application of AI algorithms to analyse patterns, transactions, and user behaviour to spot possible fraud in industries like banking, finance, and e-commerce is another example of AI in MIS. By effectively sorting through and analysing enormous volumes of data using AI techniques like machine learning and data mining, these algorithms enable businesses to make informed decisions based on the data analysed. 

Analysis
There are a variety of AI digital assistants on the market, each with particular skills and characteristics. The main distinctions between the digital assistants are listed below. Alexa is Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) digital assistant. It may be voice-activated for a variety of services and tasks, including setting reminders, playing music, delivering weather updates, and managing smart home appliances like lights and door locks. Apple's Siri, an AI assistant that works with iOS devices, is similar to Alexa in that it offers voice-activated functions and is built to connect with the Apple ecosystem. “Natural Language Processing," or NLP,  is a subfield of data science and artificial intelligence, and refers to an AI system's capacity to comprehend, understand, and reply to human language in a meaningful manner. Siri possesses these skills as well. The successful and natural communication between AI assistants and their human users is facilitated by these NLP skills. With these improvements in NLP technology, digital assistants are now much better able to comprehend and respond to human language, making them useful tools for a range of jobs and applications. 
Google Assistant is another example of a digital assistant. It is made to leverage Google's search tools and knowledge to deliver in-depth responses to inquiries. It not only carries out fundamental tasks like making reminders and giving directions, but it also interfaces with other Google services and apps, including operating your Google Home. Similarly, Microsoft’s AI digital assistant Cortana, also performs the functions of sending emails, setting reminders, and performing web searches. However, unlike the previous assistants that could either only be on IOS devices or Amazon devices, Cortana is a cross-platform application that can work on various operating systems. This allows for more access to users and more seamless interactions on multiple platforms. By giving users quick and easy methods to obtain information, complete activities, and communicate with the system, digital assistants can be useful in management information systems for many organisations. 
These AI digital assistants are inexpensive and accessible tools for organisations to utilise to gain a competitive adjective over competitors, optimise operations, and push for innovation within their management information systems. 

Conclusion
In order to create this assignment, our group first started by researching new and innovative types of technology that have the potential to affect the field of information systems and how businesses manage and process data. This research led to many examples of new and innovative types of technology. Virtual personal assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana are a few examples. The use of AI algorithms to analyse trends, transactions, and user behaviour to spot possible fraud in industries like banking, finance, and e-commerce is another example of artificial intelligence in management information systems. There are a variety of AI digital assistants on the market, each with particular skills and characteristics. However, they all have the basic makings of a digital assistant, they are voice-activated for many basic tasks, such as setting reminders, playing music, communicating the weather, and performing searches for queries. Some of the assistants are more proficient in certain areas than others, and provide different benefits for different areas. For instance, assistants such as Alexa or Google are more efficient in connecting to your smart home devices seamlessly, as opposed to Siri or Cortana. A facet of AI that we have researched in regards to digital assistants are the Natural Language Processing capabilities, or NLP. We expanded on how these AI digital assistants use NLP to varying degrees to understand and interpret human language more efficiently. Artificial Intelligence digital assistants have proven to be useful and accessible tools for an organisations’ management information systems.
